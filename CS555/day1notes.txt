Data Set Basic Statistics


Imagine you have p variables

x1, x2, x3...,xP

These are continous variables. Say height, weight, etc of a person. 
You want to study their relationships between variables

bivariate pdfs?? Probability Density Functions

Joint PDF of (x1, x2) = Integral(f(x3,...,xp) dx3...dxp
            
            cov(x1,x2) = Expectation(x1 * x2) - E(x2)
            .....
            more here but handwiting on board is crap 

In short, if we have a PDF, we can determine covariance

But in real life, we don't get nice things like having a PDF.
So lets not do this, no integration and stuff, lets just estimate using data

So we start collecting data. And our job is to determine the correlations

  x1   x2   x3   ...xP
1 x11  x12  x13 ....
2 x21  x22  x23 ...
3 .
4 .


Ok - whats Sample Mean of x1?

    Easy: Sum of all xi / n for all i -> n
    same for all other Xs
    

Now that we have Sample Means(Hats), we can calculate Sample Variance

SV(x1) = Sum of all (xi1 - x1Hat)^2/n from i -> n
SV(x2) = Sum of all (xi2 - x2Hat)^2/n from i -> n
... 
SV(xp) = Sum of all (xip - xpHat)^2/n from i -> n

Can we estimate covariance between first and second variable?
x1, x2?

Sample CoVariance(x1, x2) = Sum of all ((xi1-xiHat)(xi2-x2Hat))/n for i->n
or general: Sample CoVariance(xk, xe) = Sum of all ((xk1-xkHat)(xe2-xeHat))/n for i->n


then : 

Sample CoVariances = (Sum of all (xi1-x1hat)(xi2-x2hat) from i -> n)/
                     (SqRt(Sum of all((xi1 - x1Hat)^2)*Sum of all((xi2 - x2Hat)^2)) 



Ok - then all the Sample Covariances are put into a P*P matrix (Sample Covariance Matrix)

Can put sample correlations into P*P matrix as well


Ok, how are these two matrices related?

You take the Sample Covariance matrix(S) and multiply by its diagonal(V) (correlation matrix) and the 

LOOKUP how to get correlation matrix from covariance matrix


Imagine I have a P*P matrix and a P*1 vector (X)

X^T*A*X -> Quadratic Form (1d object, scalar) 

        = (x1, x2...xp) * (a11 a12 ... a1p)
                          (a21 a22 ....a2p)    = DoubleSum(aij * xi * xj)
                          ( |   |   |   | )      or sum of for all i->p, i->p 
                          (ap1 ap2  ...app )
 

What uses a quadratic form??
 Statistical Distance 
   How do you define distance between points in P dimensional space?
   So what is distance between x, y?
   Euclidean Distance
   SquareRt[(x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y2)^2...(xp - yp)^2)]
   Take A to be Identity Matrix p by p dimensions
   SquareRt[(x-y)T A (x-y)] 
   

We can use almost any p*p matrix A, to define statistical distance:
  d(x, y) = Sqt[(x-y)T A^-1(x-y)]


Almost any means "Positive Definite Matrices" - matrices such that no matter what you multiple them by you get a positive value or 0

The first half of notes here is important because it determines what is "far" or "close" for this data and their distances for each variable
