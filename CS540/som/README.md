Self Organizing Map program

Built with reference to https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kpang/nn/som.html and http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html,
thanks to the authors of those sites for their breakdowns of the algorithm, code samples, and demonstrating how
to use the glut library for use with openGL on linux. - on that note, you will need the glut library installed to run this.
